# Automotive Segment Case Study Real World-Data-Analysis-
I have just completed a project on Automotive Segment Analysis, and I’m excited to share my work and experience. Working with real-world data helped me understand how numbers turn into meaningful insights that support better decision-making for an organisation.
## Summary
In this study, I analysed how different automotive segments performed from January to June.
The focus was on customer visits, their interest in different segments, and how many eventually converted into leads.
This helped me understand customer demand, preferences, and buying behaviour.

## Objective
- The main goals of this case study were to:
- Understand visitor behaviour across segments
- Identify which segment is growing the fastest
- Study the relationship between visits and leads
- Analyse which segment gained more traction and why
- Track conversion trends and find improvement areas
- Provide simple recommendations based on insights

## What I Did
- Cleaned and prepared 6 months of data in Excel.
- Calculated total visits, MoM growth, and monthly conversion rates.
- Created pivot charts and graphs to analyse:
  - Conversion rate trends
  - MoM growth for each segment
  - Visitors vs leads
  - Monthly visitor traffic and segment popularity
- Summarised all findings into a PPT with visuals and charts

## Insights (Data Findings)
- EV segment showed strong, steady growth every month
- EV recorded ~13% average MoM growth, the highest among all segments
- SUV segment received the most visitors (~180K–220K per month)
- SUV growth was stable but lower at ~5%
- Hatchbacks showed fluctuating demand
- Sedans had the lowest and most unstable growth
- Visits and leads both increased, but visits grew faster, showing more customers are still at the awareness stage
- Conversion rate improved from 1.24% to 1.39%, slightly above average, showing healthy performance

## My Observations
- EVs are rising fast and gaining strong public interest
- SUVs remain the most popular in terms of traffic
- A gap exists between visitor interest and lead generation, especially for EVs
- Many customers explore EVs but are not yet ready to make a quick decision
- Hatchback and Sedan segments need stronger promotions to build stable demand

## Skills Used
**Excel Skills:**
  - Data cleaning
  - MoM growth calculations
  - Chart building and visualisation

**Analytical Skills:**
- Trend analysis
- Segmentation analysis
- Understanding visitor-to-lead conversion
- Logical reasoning for insights
- Recommendation building

## Conclusion
- EVs are the top-growing segment and gaining rapid public interest
- SUVs lead in overall traffic but show slower growth
- Hatchbacks and Sedans have unstable demand
- Conversion rates are improving but still need more optimisation
- The market is slowly moving towards electric mobility

## Recommendations
**Focus on EV Campaigns**
- Increase EV marketing
- Create EV vs Petrol comparison tools
- Add EV-specific offers like test-drive or EMI calculators

**Improve Conversion Funnels**
- Make landing pages clearer
- Add faster booking options and strong call-to-action buttons

**Use SUV Popularity for Cross-Promotion**
- Promote EVs to SUV visitors
- Run targeted EV ads for SUV audiences

**Boost Hatchback & Sedan Visibility**
- Offer discounts, features, and value-focused promotions

## What I Learned
- How each segment behaves over time
- How to interpret MoM growth and real customer demand
- Why traffic and conversions should be studied together
- How market maturity impacts growth
- How to turn raw data into simple, clear insights
- That customer interest does not always turn into immediate conversion
